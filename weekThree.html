        I started working on my frameworks, exploring different ideas as to how I wanted my website to be structured. I also looked at different portfolio websites from industry professionals for inspiration and I found some good examples. Since I am going for a simplistic design, not too distracting and not too blend as well, I decided to focus on structure and not too much on design because of time and the knowledge I have on CSS coding at the moment. Plus, the UI and UX seem a bit advanced at the moment, for the ideas I have in mind for my website. So I will stick with a simplistic wireframe for the time being.
        Regarding the CSS lectures, they were average, and I did not watch the entire thing. I was rushing to refresh my previous knowledge of them and had to refer to YouTube in order to practice better. The CSS exercises were fine though, and I was able to speed run through them quite fast. I know I said CSS can be advanced but I am a couple of weeks in on it, and I caught some fundamentals faster than others. And those that I cannot understand as of yet, have not proven useful for what I want to do for my website. But this week mainly, I was focused on beginning to code, I already have my homepage wireframe sketched out and things are coming together quite nicely.
