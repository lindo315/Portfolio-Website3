        My experience with Git
        It wasn't that bad. I already had it installed last year and only had to watch a tutorial on how to use it. Setting it up was not an issue.
        I read up on The Library of Babel. Though I didn't read it per se I listened to an audio book of it because I preferred listening to it rather than reading it. Honestly I found it boring. I tried reading it a few times and found myself wondering. Literature like that has always been my weakness, when it's too clustered with huge words and scholar sentences it makes it hard for me to focus and so I get distracted. But listening to them is much better. That way I can grasp the content easier than having to re-read sentences I find confusing. Or re-doing an entire paragraph because I dozed off. I did find it ironic though, that I had to listen to an audio book rather than reading a reading about people reading books of infinity in an infinity library of infinite books. The Library of Babel was interesting though. I'm a fan of strange stories and authors who choose to ingulf their readers with their imaginative ways of storytelling. In a way, I like all things strange fiction. 

        To talk about the story, it's about this man who describes this library that consists of every book that exist, has existed, or will ever exist. And how some books feature a random set of letters that make no sense to anyone who'd try to read or understand them. And then he goes on this rant about how he thinks that some of these books that most think to be nonsense might be books written in a language they themselves do not know. It was a fun thought to look at. And I perceived the whole thing as being how knowledge is today. Not quite infinite but also there is no limit. We might have the answers but not the right questions yet about a specific phenomena. But we wouldn't know. I have other ideas about how the story ties into the real world like how there were scholars that would visit the library only to get rid of books or literature they did not like or found to be nonsense in their own perspective. A bit like how modern media works these days. Selective information sharing. Sometimes the media is influenced by higher powers who want people to know about certain things they want them to know about. And anything they find threatening, they destroy or censor.

        Simple. I want to amp up my coding skills in the next four months. After this year already having made more than a dozen crappy websites as proof that I'm doing my best in learning to become a software dev. But having one not so bad website won't hurt. By not so bad I mean in the eyes of a professional.
