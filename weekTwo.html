        Starting HTML, I began working on it during the holidays last year December till January. I was trying to get ahead and understand the basics before school started. It was a process and after a few weeks in I had grabbed the necessary core fundamentals of the language. Working with now has been not as difficult and has been a long process as it would have if I had not worked on learning HTML during the holidays. It was not easy readjusting, but it was not difficult too. I remembered most of the stuff I had learned before. 
        In his article "Why You Should Choose HTML5", he argues that HTML5 is the best choice for building modern websites because it is more flexible, powerful, and capable than previous versions of HTML. He explains that HTML5 includes many new features that make it easier to create multimedia content, handle data input, and build dynamic web applications. This is true, when learning HTML I have found that the possibilities of what you can do with it are endless provided you know what you are doing. Now learning as a beginner can be overwhelming once you find out what professionals have done with HTML5 but still, it is inspiring to know that whatever they have built is not impossible. He also emphasizes that HTML5 is compatible with all modern browsers and devices, making it a versatile and reliable choice for web development. Additionally, Lawson notes that using HTML5 can improve website accessibility and search engine optimization, as well as reduce development costs and maintenance requirements.
        Bruce Lawson, in his video titled "How A Screen Reader User Accesses The Web", provides a demonstration of how a visually impaired person uses a screen reader to navigate and access content on the web. He discusses the challenges that screen reader users face when encountering inaccessible content and provides tips and best practices for web developers to ensure that their websites are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Overall, the video serves as a valuable resource for web developers looking to improve the accessibility of their websites.
